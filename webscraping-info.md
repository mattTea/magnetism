Web Scraping:
Aka screen scraping, web data extraction, web harvesting and others

As most websites are only viewable via a browser, web scraping is the automated method which essentially copies and pastes the info from the desired website ( https://www.webharvy.com/articles/what-is-web-scraping.html).  Web scraping software (such as WebHarvy) “will automatically load and extract data from multiple pages of websites based on your requirement. It is either custom built for a specific website or is one which can be configured to work with any website. With the click of a button you can save the data available in the website to a file in your computer.”

https://www.webscraper.io/ not sure that this offers the functionality that we would require. This exports information to csv format.

https://realpython.com/modern-web-automation-with-python-and-selenium/ again, it appears that this will provide us with data in CSV format.  This page gives information on capturing structured data and gives example code.

https://realpython.com/web-scraping-with-scrapy-and-mongodb/ This example stores data in MongoDB.  It uses the Scrapy library and PyMongo for storing the data in the DB.  This might be the option which is best suited for what I believe we want to do.

Mongo DB is a “fully managed cloud database”.  It also:


MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time 
The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with 
Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data 
MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use 
MongoDB is free to use. Versions released prior to October 16, 2018 are published under the AGPL. All versions released after October 16, 2018, including patch fixes for prior versions, are published under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) v1.
I’m aware obviously that this is MongoDB advertising itself, but sounds interesting?
